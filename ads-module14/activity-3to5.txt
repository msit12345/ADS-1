a)Build a max heap with following elements(use the same insertion order) and answer the following questions 
100,  20, 3, 101, 54, 96, 103, 71, 60
1)Number of heapify operations  required to build a max heap.
Ans.6
2) Leaf elements after performing 2nd heapify operation(Right to left).
Ans.100,101,103,20,54,96,3,71,64
3) Leaf elements after inserting all elements into max heap(First child to last child).
Ans.54,3,96,20
4) Elements at level 1 after building a heap. (Left to right)
Ans.103
5) Children of 101 after building a heap.(Left to right)
Ans.71,54,3,96,20
6)  Elements at level 1 after sorting 3 elements. (Left to right)
Ans.101,100


b)Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but only a few remove the maximum operations.
 Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, ordered array?
Ans. unordered array


c)Draw all of the different heaps that can be made from the five keys A B C D E, then draw all of the
 different heaps that can be made from the five keys A A A B B.
Ans.MIN HEAP=ABCDE,AAABB
MAX HEAP=EDCBA,BBAAA
